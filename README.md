For Secondary Approach:
For this research project, I used R Studio and Excel intermittently to double-check results, and increase efficiency.

In order to reproduce this research, download the following three datasets: DATASET2.xlsx, countyDistances.xlsx, stacked_data_test.xlsx, stacked_data_test (1).xlsx

Upload those datasets into your workspace, and run the code found in the "Official Data and Results".

The other datasets in this repository is raw data that I cleaned and used to get to the four datasets used in this project. The other two r spaces show the code of what I did to clean those datasets and merge them. 

For Primary Approach:
To see the code from R and Stata for my primary approach. See the "Approach 1" r-space. You can also download the final dataset: "year-county-data".
