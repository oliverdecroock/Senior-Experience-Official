For this research project, I used R Studio and Excel intermittently to double-check results, and increase efficiency.

In order to reproduce this research, download the following three datasets: DATASET2.xlsx, countyDistances.xlsx, stacked_data_test.xlsx, stacked_data_test (1).xlsx

Upload those datasets into your workspace, and run the code found in the "Official Data and Results".

The other datasets in this repository is raw data that I cleaned, and used to get to the four datasets used in this project. The other two r spaces show the code to what I did to clean those datasets and merge them together.
